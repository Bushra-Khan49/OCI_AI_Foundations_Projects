# Requirements, Things to Know, and Environment Preparation

### Requirements
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8 or higher (compatible with the libraries used).
- **Libraries Needed**:
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations, array handling, and generating grids.
  - `matplotlib`: For plotting the data points and decision boundaries.
  - `scikit-learn`: For generating the `make_circles` dataset and using the `MLPClassifier` neural network.
  - `ipywidgets`: For creating interactive sliders to adjust parameters like hidden layer size.
  - `IPython.display`: For displaying interactive elements in Jupyter.
- **No Additional Installs Needed**: These are standard libraries; install via pip if missing (e.g., `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn ipywidgets`).

### Things to Know
- This code demonstrates binary classification on a non-linearly separable dataset (`make_circles`), showing why neural networks (MLP) are powerful for complex patterns.
- The dataset consists of two interlocking circles: one inner and one outer, with added noise for realism.
- We use an interactive slider to change the number of neurons in the hidden layer, retraining the model each time to visualize how it affects the decision boundary.
- Key Concepts:
  - **Non-linear Separability**: Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) fail here; MLP uses hidden layers and ReLU activation to create curved boundaries.
  - **Decision Boundary**: A visualization of how the model divides the feature space into classes.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: Using ipywidgets allows real-time experimentation without rerunning code manually.
- Why MLP? It can approximate any function with enough neurons, making it ideal for non-linear data like this.
- Limitations: This is a toy example; in real scenarios (e.g., bioinformatics), scale up with more layers/data.

### Environment Preparation
- **Recommended Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (ipywidgets work best here for interactivity).
- **Setup Steps**:
  1. Open a new Jupyter Notebook.
  2. Install libraries if needed: Run `!pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn ipywidgets` in a cell.
  3. Enable ipywidgets: Run `!jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension` if interactivity doesn't work.
  4. Run the code in a single cell for the full interactive experience.
- **Testing**: After setup, run a simple test: `import ipywidgets as widgets; widgets.IntSlider()` — if a slider appears, you're good.
