# OCI_AI_Foundations_Projects

### My Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Certification Journey (2025–2026)  
**Learning in Public • Hands-On Projects • India**

This repository is a complete collection of all the projects, Jupyter notebooks, and code I am building while pursuing two official Oracle certifications:

### 1. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI Foundations Associate (2025)  
 
**Status: 100% COMPLETED** as of 11 Nov 2025  

| Module                                      | Status     | Completed On   |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|----------------|
| Module 1: Introduction to AI & ML           | Completed  | 6 Nov 2025    |
| Module 2: Supervised Learning & Neural Networks | Completed  | 6 Nov 2025    |
| Module 3: Unsupervised Learning & Feature Engineering | Completed  | 7 Nov 2025    |
| Module 4: Deep Learning & Computer Vision   | Completed  | 8 Nov 2025    |
| Module 5: NLP + Intro to Generative AI      | Completed  | 10 Nov 2025    |
| Module 6: Responsible AI & Deployment       | Completed  | 11 Nov 2025    |


### 2. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI Professional (2025)  
Starting 12 Nov 2025  

| Module                                      | Status  |
|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| Introduction to Generative AI & LLMs        | Pending |
| Prompt Engineering (Basic + Advanced)       | Pending |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)        | Pending |
| Fine-tuning & Custom Models                 | Pending |
| OCI Generative AI Service Deep Dive         | Pending |
| Building Chatbots & Agents                  | Pending |
| Evaluation, Safety & Guardrails             | Pending |
| Deployment & Monitoring                     | Pending |

All projects are built purely from the official course content and labs, executed locally using Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, etc. — no OCI cloud services used.

Every notebook is clean, well-commented, and ready to run.

More projects coming every week as I progress through both certifications.
